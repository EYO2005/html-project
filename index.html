    <h1>EYO (Web Developer)</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Eyo and I work as a web developer.
        I have been working as a web developer for quite some time now.
        I believe I am a very ambitious person who loves to work on making the website work well.
        Working on the web is my passion as I love to work on exciting projects.
    </p>
    <h2>MY SKILLS</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developers are required to be proficient at coding with languages like HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript for front-end development, and Python, Java, Ruby, and PHP for
                back-end programming. Knowledge of back-end languages is particularly useful
                for Full Stack Web Developers.
            </li>
            <li>A crucial technical skill for Web Developers is version control which allows 
                them to track and control changes made to the code.
                Git is the most widely used version control system.
            </li>
            <li>Learning to use libraries and frameworks which simplify and speed up development is essential.
                Front-end developers benefit from knowing React, jQuery, Angular, and Vue.js,
                while back-end developers should be familiar with Express, ASP.NET Core,
                Spring, Flask, and Django.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Web Developers must have the ability to validate code, verify it for bugs, and fix any errors,
                which can be a time-consuming process. They should also understand the user experience and
                design websites that are aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
            </li>
            <li>Non-technical skills required include adaptability and an openness to learning new things,
                attention to detail, focus, persistence, and good communication skills. Web Developers
                should be comfortable interacting with clients, designers, writers, SEO specialists,
                and customers.
            </li>
            <li>Web development bootcamps can help beginners acquire the necessary skills for a career
                in web development. Alternatively, individual web development classes can help gauge
                one's interest in the field before committing to a bootcamp.
